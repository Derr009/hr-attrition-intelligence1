review-12787895,Nineleaps Technology Solutions,Data Engineer,Software Development,Bangalore / Bengaluru,2020-08-01,3,"The few best things that I really do like is the work-life balance during Covid-19. The team lead has been supportive in these tough times. The job feels very secure as we have not heard a single layoff yet. 
The management really went extra mile to make it work for us.","The one thing I dislike here is that Quantity is favoured than quality. The metrics for high volume work and low volume work is not defined. 
There is no way we can define these things, so it boils down to number of tickets. Work DetailsI am a Data Engineer here. I mostly work on data modelling and ingestion. The stacks involve Python, Spark, Hadoop, docker and hive.
I need to make the data meaningful and bring it in the right format for Business Intelligence team. Work days: Monday to Friday (Flexible Timings)  Work related travel: This is a desk job.",EMP0095,Priya Nair,Active,2018-05-10 00:00:00,,5.2,5,B,Female,36
